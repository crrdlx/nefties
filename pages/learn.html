                NFTs are non-fungible tokens. That means each is unique. By contrast, a dollar bill is fungible. That means a dollar is a dollar. Even an old, dirty, worn out dollar is still worth the same as a new, clean dollar. They're fungible.
            </p>
            <p>
                NFTs are unique. Think about two tickets to the big game. You hold a front-row ticket at mid-field. A "friend" online holds a top-row ticket in the corner of the stadium and asks if you'd like to trade. Would you? I didn't think so. Those tickets are like NFTs...special and unique. Each NFT what's more, NFTs can be proven to be special, unique, and legit. Whereas tickets can be faked or counterfeit, NFTs can't.
            </p>
            <h1>NFTs are <span style="color:darkorange">growing.</h1>
            <p>
                You may have heard of CryptoKitties from 2017. They gave non-fungible tokens a first jumpstart. 2020 has seen NFTS take off even more...you've likely heard of Garbage Pale Kids. They're now NFTs. You've likely heard of POGS. They are are now KOGS, as NFTs. And, there's more. The future shows much, much greater things for NFTs.
